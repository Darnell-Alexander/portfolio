                    Lets start with a little about me personally. 
                    I have been in love with computers & programming for most of my life.
                    Building my first static website in Middle School and doing my first freelance project as a freshman in college.
                    Unique projects are my favorite, like a big puzzle that just needs a different viewpoint.
